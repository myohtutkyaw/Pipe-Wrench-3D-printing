“PIPE WRENCH”

A 3D-printed adjustable pipe wrench designed using SolidWorks and manufactured using PLA+.

📜 Background

The pipe wrench is a widely used industrial tool with a long history, originally invented in 1869 by Daniel C. Stillson and later improved by Johan Petter Johansson in 1888. It features:

One fixed jaw and one movable jaw

Serrated teeth for high grip

A mechanism allowing rotation in one direction without slipping

Most common sizes range from 150 mm to 1200 mm.
This project focuses on producing a compact 120 mm prototype via 3D printing.

🧪 Experiment & Fabrication Process

The fabrication includes:

1. Design Phase

Careful measurement and optimization of jaw shape, angles, and handle ergonomics

Ensuring grip efficiency across different pipe diameters

2. 3D Printing Phase

Entire printing process took 2 days

Each part printed layer-by-layer using PLA+

3. Post-Processing

Cleaning, sanding, smoothing raw printed components

Assembling and checking mechanical fit

4. Testing & Iteration

Tested grip strength on various pipe sizes

Identified fit and tolerance issues

Re-printed parts multiple times to achieve a fully functional assembly
